HOL - Continuous Deployment with Release Management in Visual Studio Team Services
==================================================================================
In this lab, you have an application called PartsUnlimited, committed to a Git repository in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and a Continuous Integration build that builds the app and runs unit tests whenever code is pushed to the master branch.
Please refer to the [HOL - Parts Unlimited WebSite Continuous Integration with Visual Studio Team Services](ci) in order to see how the CI build was set up.
Now you want to set up Release Management (a feature of Visual Studio Team Services) to be able continuously deploy the application to an Azure Web App.
Initially the app will be deployed to a `dev` deployment slot. The `staging` slot will require and approver before the app is deployed into it. Once an approver approves the `staging` slot,
the app will be deployed to the production site.

## Pre-requisites:
* An active Visual Studio Team Services account
* Project Admin rights to the Visual Studio Team Services account
* An active Azure account to host the PartsUnlimited Website as a Web App


	> **Note**: In order to use deployment slots, you'll need to configure the Web App to use Standard or Premium App Service Plan mode. You **cannot** create deployment slots for Basic or Free Azure Web Apps. To learn more about deployment slots, see [this article](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-staged-publishing/).

* You have completed the * [HOL - Parts Unlimited WebSite Continuous Integration with Visual Studio Team Services](ci)

* A Service Primcipal in your Azure account

	> **Note**: This is required because deploying [ARM Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-authoring-templates/) to Azure requires an organizational account or a [Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-application-objects). MSA Account and certificate-based connections are not supported. In this lab task, we will use a service principal

## Tasks Overview:
**1. Complete the * [HOL - Parts Unlimited WebSite Continuous Integration with Visual Studio Team Services](ci).**
This will walk through creating a Visual Studio Team Services account, committing the PartsUnlimited source code and setting up the Continuous Integration (CI) build.

**2. Modify the CI Build to include ARM Templates**
The source code already defines the infrastructure required by the application in code (Infrastructure as Code). 
The code is a json file based on the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template schema. You will use the template to deploy or update the infrastructure as part of the release.

**3. Create a Service Endpoint in Visual Studio Team Services to an Azure Account.**
In this step you'll download your Azure publish settings file and create Service Endpoint in Visual Studio Team Services for your Azure account.
This will enable you to configure deployment of the PartsUnlimited Website to Azure as an Azure Web Application from Builds or Releases.

**4. Create a Release Pipeline for the Parts Unlimited Website.**
In this step, you will create a Release definition for the PartsUnlimited Website.
You'll use the CI build output as the input artefact for the Release and then define how the release moves through `environments` with approvals in between.

**5. Trigger a Release.**
Once the Release Definition is set up, you will trigger a release and see the pipeline in action.

## HOL:
### Task 1: Complete HOL - Parts Unlimited Website Continuous Integration with Visual Studio Team Services
Make sure you've completed [HOL - Parts Unlimited Website Continuous Integration with Visual Studio Team Services](ci).

### Task 2: Modify the CI Build to include the ARM Templates
In order to deploy to Azure, you're going to specify the infrastructure that the PartsUnlimited Website requires.
For example, the site requires an Azure SQL Database and an Azure Web App.
Rather than create these by hand, you are going to use the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates that describe this infrastructure in a json file.
This is good practice, since you're describing infrastructure as code.

The task that will deploy the ARM template will create the resource group if it does not exist.
If the resource group does exist, then the template is used to update the existing resources.

> **Note:** The infrastructure described in the ARM templates for this HOL will create resources that are not free.
It creates an Azure Web App with 3 deployment slots.
Deployment slots are only available on Standard or Premium App Service Plans.
They are **not** available on Free or Basic plans.
Once you've completed this lab, you probably want to delete the resource group in order to minimize charges to your Azure account.

**Step 1.** Log into your VSTS account and click on the **Build and Releases > Build** hub.

**Step 2.** Click the Build that you configured in the Continuous Integration HOL, and click **Edit**, as per the screenshot below. 

![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/VSTSBuilddefEdit.png)

**Step 3.** Click the  **+** to add a Task, click **Utility > Publish Build Artifacts** and configure it as follows, then save it when finished the configuration.


- Version = **< default value >**
- Display name= **Publish Artifact: ARMTemplates**
- Path to Publish = **env/Templates** (click the elipsis at the en dof the box,browse to **env\templates** and click **OK**)
- Artifact Name= ARMTemplates
- Artifact Type = Server 
- Control Options = < ensure **Enabled** is checked>

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/VSTS_PublishARMTemplate1.png)
	


**Step 4.** To verify the Build is working corrcetly with the additional task, queue a new build by clicking the **Queue** button and confirming again by clicking **Queue**. When the build has completed, verify that there are 2 folders: drop and ARMTemplates.

- The **drop** folder should contain a single file: PartsUnlimitedWebsite.zip (click **Explore** to view the contents or **Download** and extract it)

- The **ARMTemplates** folder should contain a number of environment template and parameters JSON files.

![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/VSTSArtifactsExplorer.png)

### Task 3: Create a Service Endpoint from VSTS to an Azure Account
In order to interact with Azure, you'll need to create a Service Endpoint in VSTS.This Endpoint includes the authentication information required to deploy to Azure.

> **Note**: Deploying [ARM Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-authoring-templates/) to Azure from VSTS requires an organizational account or a [Service Principal](http://blog.jstroheker.com/2016/10/11/SPNAzure/). MSA Accounts and certificate-based connections are not supported. For this HOL, we will create a Service Principal.

> **Note**: There are many ways to create a Service Principal (SP) in Azure, we will use the **Azure CLI 2.0**. Details on using Azure CLI 2.0 to Create a SP can be viewed on the page https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest 

**Step 1.**  Install the Azure CLI 2.0 if it is not already installed by following the steps here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest based on your environment.


**Step 2.** Once **Azure CLI 2.0** is installed, open Azure CLI 2.0 and log into Azure by running the below command and following the prompts

	az login


**Step 3.** Create a SP by running the command, the output shoudl be similar to the screenshot below.


	az ad sp create-for-rbac --name PU1app --password Pa$$w0rd01


![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/SPN1.png)

**Step 4.** Check the permissions on the newly created SP and ensure it has a **RoleDefinitionName**= **Contributor**, by running the below command


	az role assignment list --assignee  <app id from earlier > i.e. 5c0e5186-737c-42ad-881e-16d735ac3dab


![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/SPN2.png)

**Step 5.** Log in with the SP to verify access is working fine by running the below command 


	az login --service-principal -u <APP_ID> --password <PWD> --tenant <TENANT_ID>


![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/SPN3.png)

> **Note**: You will need the below three values from the SP account to be able to successfully create the Service Endpoint in VSTS, you should note them now for use later.
- **Tenant ID**
- **Password (also referred to as Service Principal Key)**
- **User name (also referred to as App ID)**


**Step 6.**  Create an Azure Service Endpoint in VSTS by clicking on the **Settings** icon at the top of the page, selecting **Services** and then **New Service Endpoint** and selecting **Azure Resource Manager** from the drop down list.

![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/VSTSCreateSPpage.png)

**Step 7.** In the **Add Azure Resource Manager Service Endppoint** dalogue, click on the link **use the full version of the endpoint dialog**

![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/CrateSPDialogueadvlink.png)

**Step 8.** Fill in the fields required as per the information you obtained earlier when creating your SP, click **Verify connection** and ensure you can successfully verify the connection to Azure

![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/SPVerifyConnection.png)

**Step 9.** Click **OK**, and you should now see the new Service Endppoint listd in VSTS

![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/SPCreated.png)



### Task 4: Create a Release Definition
Now that you have an Azure Service Endpoint to deploy to, and a package to deploy (from your CI build), you can create a Release Definition.
The Release Definition defines how your application moves through various Environments, including Tasks to update infrastructure, deploy your application, run scripts and run tests. You can also configure incoming or outgoing approvals for each Environment.

An Environment is simply a logical grouping of tasks - it may or may not correspond to a set of machines.

For this Release Definition, you will create 3 Environments: Dev, Staging and Production.

The infrastructure required for all 3 environments is described in an ARM Template. The ARM Template will be invoked during the deployment in the Dev Environment before deploying the website to Dev. It will not be necessary to run any infrastructure tasks during Staging or Production deployments in this case.

**Step 1.**  Create a Release Definition to Deploy Infrastructure and Deploy to Dev

1. In VSTS, click on **Builds and Releases**. Then click on the **+ New definition** button to create a new definition.


	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/VSTSReleaseDef1.png)

2. You are brough to the **New Release Definition** page and the **Select a Template** pane. Click on **Empty** to start with an empty release and click **Apply**, accept the defaults on the Environment page of the wizard and click **Save** and **OK** to confirm. The template has created a single Environment (called **Environment 1**).
![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/VSTSReleaseDef2.png)
![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/VSTSReleaseDef3.png)


3. Close the ** Environment 2 pane**, click the blue pencil beside New release definition to edit the release definition name and enter **PartsUnlimited** into the name field at the top to name this Release Definition.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/VSTSReleasedef4.png)

4. Under the **Pipeline** tab in **Artifacts** click **+ Add** and enter the following details in the Add Artifact dialogue, then click **Add**. 

	- Source Type = **Build**
	- Project = **HOL**
	- Source (Build definition)Type= **HOL-CI** (or the name you called the build definintion when you created your CI build earlier)
	- Default version = **Latest**)
	- Source alias = **HOL-CI**


	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/VSTSAddArtifact1.png)

5. To link the release definition to the build definition, click the **lightning icon** in the Artifacts HOL-CI definition to launch the **Continuous Deployment trigger** dialogue, and configure it as below and click **Save** when finished.

	- Enabled/Disable slider = **Enabled**
	- Build branch = **master** Project = **HOL**

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/CDTrigger1.png)


6. Close the **Continuous Deployment trigger** dialogue and click and select **Environment 1**.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/RelTasksDev1.png)

7. Click the name label **Environment 1** and change the name to **Dev**.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/RelTasksDev2.png)

8. On the agent phase click on the **+** to add a tasks to the phase, then click **Deploy** followed by **Azure Resource Group Deployment** and then click the **Add**
 to add the task. Close the "Task catalogue" dialog.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/DevinfraTask1.png)

9. Click on the **Azure Resource Group Deployment** task and configure it as follows:
	
	- Version = **< default >** 
	- Display name = **< default >**
	- Azure Subscription = **Azure SP** (or the vlaue thats listed inthe drop down box that you configured for your service endpoint)
	- Action = **Create or Update Resource Group**
	- Resource group = **$(ResourceGroupName)**
	- Location = **your nearest Azure datacenter**
	- Template Location = **Linked Artifact**
	- Template = **$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/HOL-CI/ARMTemplates/FullEnvironmentSetupMerged.json** (i.e. click the ellipsis button and browse to the template file **FullEnvironmentSetupMerged.json** in the build artifacts.
	- Template parameters = **$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/HOL-CI/ARMTemplates/FullEnvironmentSetupMerged.param.json** (i.e. click the ellipsis button and browse to the template file **FullEnvironmentSetupMerged.param.json** in the build artifacts.
	- Override template parameters = Copy and paste the below in a single line (shown split here for convenience). It would be wise to copy into a text editor, such as notepad first to ensure formatting is as expected and to remove any potential character corruption, then copy from that editor into VSTS. Copy inside the content contained inside arrows. It should look lik ethe below screenshot.


		**FROM HERE >>>** -WebsiteName $(WebsiteName) -PartsUnlimitedServerName $(ServerName) -PartsUnlimitedHostingPlanName $(HostingPlan) -CdnStorageAccountName $(StorageAccountName) -CdnStorageContainerName $(ContainerName) -CdnStorageAccountNameForDev $(StorageAccountName)-dev -CdnStorageContainerNameForDev $(ContainerName)-dev -CdnStorageAccountNameForStaging $(StorageAccountName)-stage -CdnStorageContainerNameForStaging $(ContainerName)-stage -PartsUnlimitedServerAdminLoginPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '$(AdminPassword)' -AsPlainText -Force) -PartsUnlimitedServerAdminLoginPasswordForTest (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '$(AdminTestPassword)' -AsPlainText -Force) **<<<TO HERE**

			
	You will shortly define the values for each parameter, like **$(ServerName)**, in the **Variables** section.
		
	> **Note**: If you open the **FullEnvironmentSetupMerged.param.json** file, you will see empty placeholders for these parameters. You could hard code values in the file instead of specifying them as **overrides**. Either way is valid. If you do specify values in the params file remember that in order to change values, you would have to edit the file, commit and create a new build in order for the Release to have access the new values.


	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/DevinfraTask2.png)


10. Click on the **Variables** tab, and under Process variables click **+ Add** and add the following variables choosing appropriate unique values where needed, as per the below screenshot

	- **WebsiteName**: Name of the website in Azure

	- **ServerName**: Prefix for the name of the database servers. Will have **-dev** or **-stage** added for dev/staging
	
	- **HostingPlan**: Name of the hosting plan for the website
	
	- **StorageAccountName**: Storage account name prefix. Will have **-dev** or **-stage** added for dev/staging
	
	- **ContainerName**: Container name prefix. Will have **-dev** or **-stage** added for dev/staging
	
	- **AdminPassword**: Admin password for production database server. It must meet the minimum password requirements for Azure i.e. can use Pa$$w0rd01
	
	- **AdminTestPassword**: Admin password for dev and staging database servers, again must meet minimum password complexity standards in Azure. i.e. can use Pa$$w0rd01
	
	- **ResourceGroupName**: Name of the Resource Group.

	> **Note**: Use unique values for your variables by adding something custom at the end like your initials. Example for WebsiteName : pudncorejstr, and do not add characters that are not allowed for resource object names in Azure such as **-** etc, otherwise you will receieve errors when the infrastructure is deployed to Azure 

	> **Note**: You can hide passwords and other sensitive fields by clicking the padlock icon to the right of the value text box.


	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/VariablesDef1.png)
	

11. Save the definition.

**Step 2.** Test the ARM Template Deployment

Before moving on, it is a good idea to test the template so far.

1. Click on **+ Release ** in the toolbar and select "Create Release" to start a new release.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/CreateRelease1.png)

2. In the **Create new release** dialogue select **Artifacts** and choose the repo source and latest build from the version drop-down.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/Createrelease2.png)

3. Still In the **Create new release** dialogue select **Deployment Trigger** and choose the Environment to be **Dev** and the trigger to be **Automated after release creation** and click **Queue**

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/Createrelease3.png)


4. Click the **Release-x** link to open and view the release.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/CreateRelease4.png)

5. Click on the **Logs** link to open and monitor the deployment logs.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/ReleaseRun1.png)

6. You should see a successful release after a few minutes.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/ReleaseRun2.png)

7. If you log into the Azure Portal, you will see the Resource Group has been created along with the various resource objects.This is basically the infrastructure required for the Parts Unlimted App. You should see the resource group, and within that the
	- App service plan
	- SQL Server - (three of them, one each for dev, staging & production)
	- SQL database - (three of them, one each for dev, staging & production) 
	- App service – This is the production site
	- Web App (two slots one for dev and one for staging)
	- Application Insights resources (three of them, one each for dev, staging & production)). Note that these will be deployed to East US regardless if you specify a different location, this is hard coded in the template file. You can open up the template files up to view the configuration

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/Deployed1.png)

**Step 3.**  Add Web Deployment Tasks to Deploy the Web App

Now that the infrastructure deployment is configured, you can add a task to deploy the web app to Dev infrastructure.

1. Click on the **Dev** environment in the Release Definition, then click **+** to add a task to the phase.
2. Click on the **Deploy** tab, then highlight the **Azure App Service Deploy** task and click **Add** to add the task.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/AzureAppServiceDeployAdd.png)

3. Click on the "Azure App Service Deploy" Task and configure it as follows (some fields only become visible when certain values are entered).

	- Version = **< default >** 
	- Display name = **< default >**
	- Azure Subscription = **Azure SP** (or the value that is listed in the drop down box that you configured for your service endpoint)
	- App Service Name = **$(WebsiteName)** (You defined this variable earlier when deploying the ARM Template)
	- Deploy to slot = **check the checkbox**
	- Resource group = **$(ResourceGroupName)**
	- Slot = **Dev** (This will deploy the site to the "dev" deployment slot. This allows you to deploy the site to an Azure deployment slot without affecting the Production site.)
	- Virtual Application = **< default >** 
	- Package or Folder  = **$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/HOL-CI/drop/partsunlimited.zip** (click the ellipsis button at the end and find the PartsUnlimited.zip in in the **drop** folder among the linked Artifacts)
	- File Transform & Variable Substitution Options = **< default >** 
	- Additional Deployment Options > Deployment script type = **< default >**
	- Additional Deployment Options > Take App Offline = **check the checkbox** (This stops the website for deployment period and takes it back online afterwards. This should ensure we get no files locked or in use that we can’t overwrite when we deploy to an existing site. It is required because sites receive requests all the time causing files to lock down (i.e. making them unmodifiable).)
	- Additional Deployment Options > Publish using Web deploy = **< default >**  (If you were to receive file locked errors, you could check this checkbox and specfiy a value here such as **-retryInterval:6000 -retryAttempts:10**, however you do not need to enter this value to deploy the app and can leave it blank.)
	- Output = **< default >**  
	- Control Options = ensure **Enabled** checkbox is checked


	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/AzureAppServiceDeployConfig.png)


	> **Note**:
	It is a good practice to run smoke tests to validate the website after deployment, or to run load tests.
	The code-base you are using does not have any such tests defined.
	You can also run quick cloud-performance tests to validate that the site is up and running.
	For more information on quick load tests, see [this video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Connect-event-2015/Cloud-Loading-Testing-in-Visual-Studio-Team-Service) from around the 6 minute mark.



14. Click **Save** to save the Release Definition.

**Step 4.**  Test the Dev Environment

You will shortly clone the Dev Environment into both Staging and Prod environments. However, before you do that it's a good idea to test that the Dev Environment is correctly configured by creating a new Release.

1. Click on the **+ Release** button and select Create Release.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/CreateRelease5.png)

2. In the **Create new release** dialogue select **Artifacts** and choose the repo source and latest build from the version drop-down.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/Createrelease2.png)

3. Still In the **Create new release** dialogue select **Deployment Trigger** and choose the Environment to be **Dev** and the trigger to be **Automated after release creation** and click **Queue**

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/Createrelease3.png)


4. Click the **Release-x** link to open and view the release.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/CreateRelease4.png)

5. Click on the **Logs** link to open and monitor the deployment logs.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/ReleaseRun3.png)

6. Once the deployment completes, you can check that the site was in fact deployed successfully by navigating to the site url.

	> Since you deployed to the dev slot, you will need to navigate to <br/> **http://{siteName}-dev.azurewebsites.net** where siteName is the name of your Web App in Azure. <br/> You can obtain the URL from opening the **Dev** Web App in Azure and copying the URL from within the **Overview** pane.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/DeployedtoDevIE.png)

	> You can also go to the staging and production sites, i.e.<br/> **http://{siteName}-staging.azurewebsites.net** and **http://{siteName}.azurewebsites.net**. <br/>The pages will resolve but the app has not been deployed to them yet, so is not present.
	
	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/DeployedtoStagingIE1.png)

	> It is not uncommon to receive errors and have a failed deployment in your first runs. If you do receive errors and the deployment fails, work through the errors one by one and re-run the deployment as you go to troubleshoot, until you get a successful deployment. 

**Step 5.**  Clone the **Dev** environment to **Staging** and **Production** and configure**Continuous Deployment** Conditions

Now that you have verified that the Dev Environment is configured correctly, you can clone it to Staging and Production.

1. Open the Release Definition to edit it.

	> **Note:** It is possible to change the definition for a Release without changing the Release Definition (i.e. the Release is an instance of the Release Definition that you can edit). You want to make sure that you are editing the Release Definition, not a Release.

2. In the release definition click on the **Pipeline** tab, hover the mouse over the **Dev** environment and click **Clone** icon underneath the **Dev** box (this is hidden until you hover over the environment box)

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/Clone1.png)


3. A new Environment is created. Enter **Staging** for the **Environment name**. You can then click the **X** in the right hand corber of the Environment dialogue to close it.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/Stagingconfig1.png)

4. Click **Tasks** and select **Staging**

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/Stagingconfig2.png)


5. Click the **Azure Deployment** task and in the configuration pane click  **X Remove**. This is not required in this Staging environment since the ARM template deployed the infrastructure for all 3 environments in the Dev environment. Click **Save** when finished.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/Stagingconfig3.png)


6. Configure the **Staging** deployment task by leaving all configuration values the same except for the below, click **Save** when finished. Thsi will ensure this task deploys into our **Staging** slot in **Azure App Services*, rather than the **Dev** slot.

	- Slot = **Staging**


	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/ConfigStaging1.png)



7. Click **Pipeline** and on the **Staging** environment click the **Pre-deployment conditions** icon present at the start of the **Staging** environment box

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/StagingPredeployConds1.png)


8. Configure the **Pre-deployment conditions** pane **Triggers** section as below, to trigger a staging deployment after the dev deployment is completed. 

	- Select trigger = **After environment**
	- Environments = **Dev** 

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/StagingPredeployConds2.png)

9. Configure the **Pre-deployment conditions** pane **Pre-deployment approvers** section as below, to configure approval before deployment starts in the Staging environemnt. In this case, you want to pause the deployment coming in. This ensures that if someone is testing in the Staging environment,they don't suddenly get a new build unexpectedly

	- Approval Type = **Specific users**
	- Select approvers = **<enter a user name that is configured in your project>** 

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/StagingPredeployConds3.png)

10. Close the **Pre-deployment conditions** dialogue by clicking the **X** in the top right hand corner of the dialogue and **Save** the release definition

11. Click the **Post-deployment conditions** icon at the end of the **Staging** environment box

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/StagingPostdeployConds1.png)

12. Configure the **Post-deployment conditions** pane **Post-deployment approvers** section as below, then save the release defintion and close the dialogue when finished configuring it.

	- Approval Type = **Specific users**
	- Select approvers = **< enter a user name that is configured in your project >** 


	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/StagingPostdeployConds2.png)


	> **Pre-deployment approvers**: must approve a deployment coming _into_ the environment. The deployment will stop and wait before executing any tasks in the environment until approval is granted.<br/> **Post-deployment approvers** approve deployments so that the _next_ Environment can begin. They act as sign-off for the current environment.<br/> **Approvers** can be individuals or groups.

	> **Email recipients and Notifications**: In the old VSTS editor it was possible to select an option to send email to a particular recipient in the **Pre** and **Post-deployment approval** dialogues. That is no longer possible in the deployment approval dialogues, rather it is done via the **Notifications** settings, as in the screenshot below. From within here you can create a **New Subscription** to various levels and types of notifications, as well as opt out of communications. You can view more details on the page [Manage Your notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/notifications/manage-personal-notifications)

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/Notifications.png)


13. Clone the **Staging** environment and in the Environment dialogue change the Environment name to **Production**.

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/ProdConfig1.png)

14. Click **Tasks** and select **Production** 
	
	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/ProdConfig2.png)

15. Click on **Azure App Service Deploy: $(WebsiteName)** and Uncheck the setting **Deploy to slot**. (As this deployment will not deploy to a slot but to production)

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/ProdConfig3.png)


16. Click on **Pipeline** and then **Production** environment and check the **Pre-deploymet conditions** are set as below

	- Triggers
		* Select trigger = **After environment**
		* Environments = **Staging** 
	- Pre-deployment approvers
		* Approval Type = **Specific users**
		* Select approvers = **< enter a user name that is configured in your project >** 


	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/ProdConfig4.png)

17. Now verify the **Post-deployment conditions** are configured as below

	- Approval Type = **Specific users**
	- Select approvers = **< enter a user name that is configured in your project >** 

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/ProdConfig5.png)


18. Now in the **Dev** environment configure **Pre-deployment conditions** as below

	- Triggers
		* Select trigger = **After release**
		* Artifact filters = **< default >**
	- Pre-deployment approvers
		* Approval Type = **Specific users**
		* Select approvers = **< enter a user name that is configured in your project >** 

	![](/PartsUnlimited/assets/cd2/DevPreDeployConfig1.png)

	> **Note:** We configured our continuous deployment condition earlier in the Artifacts configuration in the pipeline and now defined out pre-deploymeny conditions for the Dev environment deployment, meaning that any time the artifact build completes, a new release will automatically start using the latest build in the Dev enviroment. We will not configure post deployment options for the Dev environemnt in this scenario.


19. Save the Release Definition.


	> **Note:** We have now configured our build and release definitions so that... <br/> Deployment to **Dev** environment will be triggered after a new **Build Artifact is created**.<br/> Deployment to **Staging** can be triggered on successful deployment to **Dev**.<br/>	Deployment to **Production** can be triggered on successful deployment to **Staging**.

	> **Note:** Also, since the incoming build for this release is a CI build, in a real world deployment you probably wouldn't want to deploy the build all the way to Production. Setting the Release to stop at Dev could mean that you could create a separate Release defintion with Production as the target environment if you want to deploy to Production. This is of course configurable according to your own preferences and requirements.


### Task 5: Create a Release
Now that you have configured the Release Pipeline, you are ready to trigger a complete
release.

1. Click on **+ Release** to create a new Release.

2. In the **Create new release** dialogue select **Artifacts** and choose the repo source and latest build from the version drop-down.

3. Still In the **Create new release** dialogue select **Deployment Trigger** and configure the Environment and trigger values as follows, then click **Queue**

	- **Dev** = **Automated after release creation**
	- **Staging** = **Automated after Dev environment**
	- **Production** = **Automated after Production environment**

	> **Note**: You can adjust whether to deploy this release to a particular environment.

3. Go to **Releases** then **All Release definitions** and then click on the ellipsis beside the latest release, and select **Open** to view the release

5. This will trigger the release into the **Staging** environment. And once the Staging deployment has completed, you will need to approve that **Staging** has deployed successfully, as you have done for **Dev**. You can also view approvals in the **Summary** pane

6. Continue Approving deployments as they arise until you have successfully deployed into **Production**.
7. When your release is complete view the release logs, to see a successful deployment to all environments.

8. Open the Azure portal and obtan the URL for each of the deployments, and then go to the web pages for your Dev, Staging and Production sites i.e. **http://{siteName}-dev.azurewebsites.net**, **http://{siteName}-staging.azurewebsites.net** and **http://{siteName}.azurewebsites.net**. Verify the app is now visible on all sites.
